# Simple Batch Script with Message Box and Popups

## Description

This is a simple batch script that demonstrates how to:
1. Display a message box with "Yes" and "No" options.
2. Perform different actions based on the user's choice.
3. Create multiple small pop-up windows if the "Yes" option is selected.

## Purpose

This script is intended as a learning tool for batch scripting and demonstrating basic user interaction and process creation. **It is not intended for malicious use.**

## Usage

1.  Save the code as a file with a `.bat` extension (e.g., `popup_demo.bat`).
2.  Double-click the `.bat` file to run it.

## **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️**

**This script will create multiple pop-up windows if you click "Yes".** This can be disruptive. Please run this script responsibly and only on systems where you have permission.

## Code Explanation

*   The script uses VBScript temporarily to create the initial message box and the subsequent pop-ups.
*   It checks the return value of the message box to determine the user's choice.
*   If "Yes" is chosen, it enters a loop to create 20 separate pop-up windows using the `start` command.
*   If "No" is chosen, it uses the `taskkill` command to terminate the batch file process.
